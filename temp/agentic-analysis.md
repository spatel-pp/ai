# Agentic AI Section Analysis

## Current State
- Basic explanation of what Agentic AI is
- Simple feature grid with 4 key characteristics
- Chain-of-Thought example as static text
- Brief mention of MCP servers

## Areas for Improvement

### 1. Explanation Enhancement
- Add relatable analogies (like we did for RAG)
- Provide concrete real-world examples
- Explain the progression from simple AI to agentic AI

### 2. Chain-of-Thought Demo
- Current: Static prompt example
- Proposed: Interactive step-by-step demonstration
- Show the AI's reasoning process visually
- Allow users to explore different scenarios

### 3. Better Structure
- Add "Why Agentic AI Matters" section
- Include comparison with traditional AI
- Show progression of capabilities

## Demo Ideas
1. Interactive Chain-of-Thought reasoning for a specific problem
2. Visual representation of the thinking process
3. Multiple example scenarios users can explore
4. Step-by-step breakdown with explanations
